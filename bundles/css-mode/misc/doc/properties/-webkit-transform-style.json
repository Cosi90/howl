  "longDescription": "<p>If <code>-webkit-transform-style</code> is <code>flat</code>, all children of this element are rendered flattened into the 2D plane of the element. Therefore, rotating the element about the x or y axes causes children positioned at positive or negative z positions to appear on the element’s plane, rather than in front of or behind it. If <code>-webkit-transform-style</code> is <code>preserve-3d</code>, this flattening is not performed, so children maintain their position in 3D space.</p>\n<p>This flattening takes place at each element, so preserving a hierarchy of elements in 3D space requires that each ancestor in the hierarchy have the value <code>preserve-3d</code> for <code>-webkit-transform-style</code>. But <code>-webkit-transform-style</code> affects only an element’s children; the leaf nodes in a hierarchy do not require the <code>preserve-3d</code> style.</p>\n\n",
