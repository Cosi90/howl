    %p
      Howl is a general purpose, text oriented, editor, that aims to be both light-weight
      and fully customizable. It's built on top of the very fast
      #{link_to "LuaJIT", "http://luajit.org"} runtime, and can be extended in either
      #{link_to "Lua", "http://www.lua.org"} or #{link_to "Moonscript", "http://www.moonscript.org"}.

      It is released as free software under the #{link_to "MIT", "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"}
      license, with the source being available on #{link_to "Github", "https://github.com/nilnor/howl"}.

    %h2 Try it out!
    %p
      Howl is not yet officially released, but you can try it out if you're willing to build it
      from source. Howl is developed on Linux, but it should build on other *NIX platforms as well
      such as the *BSD family, although your mileage may vary. Have a look at the
      installation instructions for more information.

        Documentation is currently being worked on, and it's not really there yet.
        It will be available before the release, and will be incrementally added. Have a
        look at the link below to see what's currently available.

    -#   A good place to start off is the #{link_to "User manual", "doc/manual/"}, which should hopefully
    -#   get you off the ground.
    -# %p
    -#   If you're interested in what you can do with Howl, and how you can bend it to your will,
    -#   head over to the #{link_to "Developer manual", "doc/dev/"}.
