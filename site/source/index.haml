    %p
      Howl is a general purpose, text oriented, editor, that aims to be both light-weight
      and fully customizable. It's built on top of the very fast
      #{link_to "LuaJIT", "http://luajit.org"} runtime, and can be extended in either
      #{link_to "Lua", "http://www.lua.org"} or #{link_to "Moonscript", "http://www.moonscript.org"}.

      It is released as free software under the #{link_to "MIT", "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"}
      license, with the source being available on #{link_to "Github", "https://github.com/nilnor/howl"}.

    %p
      Howl is #{link_to "available", "getit.html"} as pre-built binary package for Linux. If you prefer to,
      or if you're not on Linux, you can build it from source. Howl should build on other *NIX platforms as well
      such as the *BSD family, although your mileage may vary. Have a look at the
      installation instructions for more information.
