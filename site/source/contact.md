## Contact

Any feedback, be it patches, feature request or bug reports is most welcome.

If you want to provide patches, the preferred way of doing so would be as a pull
request via GitHub, or as a pull request from some other Git server. Should that
not be an option patches can be sent over email as well.

If you have any bug reports or feature requests, you can submit these to the
[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl/issues). There's also
a subreddit for the Howl editor on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), so don't
hesitate to post there with questions or general announcements:
[r/howleditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/howleditor).

Get in contact via email: \<nino at nordman.org\>.
